# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
This was a fairly basic project that combined some simple HTML mark-up and CSS styling with media queries for desktop + mobile browsers. It took me about 2.5 hours to complete this challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
I first started with adding a class to each of the three car elements as well as the entire container. I goofed up at the beginning by assigning them their own class (sedan, SUV, luxury) and went back to change them to the same class since the styling was the same. I then imported the Google fonts and set the default styles + fonts for the stylesheet. I'm still learning the box-sizing: border-box element but I am getting there :) After that I found out I needed to add a SECOND class to each car to target the background color needed for each. Again, still learning :) Once I did that I was able to do the button:hover styling quickly and finished by adding the media query for the size indicated in the challenge.

For this I used:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Media queries

## Continued development

I still need to understand the default styles better and media queries as well. I got stuck with the layout of the entire project, and I figured out instead of focusing on getting the overall layout centered, I should work through each element first. So, get the basic colors down for the whole document, set the default margin and padding, etc. and then moving to the elements and getting those squared away so I know where to hook my style on to.
