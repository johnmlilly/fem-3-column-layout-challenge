# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview
This was a fairly basic project that combined some simple HTML mark-up and CSS styling with media queries for desktop + mobile browsers. It took me about 2.5 hours to complete this challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
I first started with adding a class to each of the three car elements as well as the entire container. I goofed up at the beginning by assigning them their own class (sedan, SUV, luxury) and went back to change them to the same class since the styling was the same. I then imported the Google fonts and set the default styles + fonts for the stylesheet. I'm still learning the box-sizing: border-box element but I am getting there :) After that I found out I needed to add a SECOND class to each car to target the background color needed for each. Again, still learning :) Once I did that I was able to do the button:hover styling quickly and finished by adding the media query for the size indicated in the challenge.

For this I used:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Media queries

## Continued development

I still need to understand the default styles better and media queries as well. I got stuck with the layout of the entire project, and I figured out instead of focusing on getting the overall layout centered, I should work through each element first. So, get the basic colors down for the whole document, set the default margin and padding, etc. and then moving to the <div> elements and getting those squared away so I know where to hook my style on to.
